## Dev Environment Setup

If you're contributing or building the Unity package yourself, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Unity (6.1 LTS or newer recommended)
- Node.js (we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install)

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

### Install Build Tools

Install Jake (task runner) and CoffeeScript compiler:

```bash
npm install -g jake coffeescript
```

> **Note:** Global install is required for CLI commands like `jake` to work in terminal.

### Verify Setup

Run the following to list available tasks:

```bash
jake -T
```

To build the Unity `.unitypackage` export:

```bash
jake unity:export-package -c
```

This will print a message like:

```
[INFO] Using unity path: /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/...
```

The built `.unitypackage` will be located under the `unity/` directory.

## Using the Unity Project

You can also just open the Unity project located at `/unity/` in the Unity Hub to explore or test the package in action.

## Input System Compatibility

.Command supports toggling the in-game console with the backquote key (`` ` ``). If you're using Unity's **new Input System**, make sure to:
